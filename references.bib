  abstract = {Inland waters have received only slight consideration in recent discussions of the global fisheries crisis, even though inland fisheries provide much-needed protein, jobs, and income, especially in poor rural communities of developing countries. Systematic overfishing of fresh waters is largely unrecognized because of weak reporting and because fishery declines take place within a complex of other pressures. Moreover, the ecosystem consequences of changes to the species, size, and trophic composition of fish assemblages are poorly understood. These complexities underlie the paradox that overexploitation of a fishery may not be marked by declines in total yield, even when individual species and long-term sustainability are highly threatened. Indeed, one of the symptoms of intense fishing in inland waters is the collapse of particular stocks even as overall fish production rises---a biodiversity crisis more than a fisheries crisis.},

  abstract = {Motivation: In life sciences, interpretability of machine learning models is as important as their prediction accuracy. Linear models are probably the most frequently used methods for assessing feature relevance, despite their relative inflexibility. However, in the past years effective estimators of feature relevance have been derived for highly complex or non-parametric models such as support vector machines and RandomForest (RF) models. Recently, it has been observed that RF models are biased in such a way that categorical variables with a large number of categories are preferred.Results: In this work, we introduce a heuristic for normalizing feature importance measures that can correct the feature importance bias. The method is based on repeated permutations of the outcome vector for estimating the distribution of measured importance for each variable in a non-informative setting. The P-value of the observed importance provides a corrected measure of feature importance. We apply our method to simulated data and demonstrate that (i) non-informative predictors do not receive significant P-values, (ii) informative variables can successfully be recovered among non-informative variables and (iii) P-values computed with permutation importance (PIMP) are very helpful for deciding the significance of variables, and therefore improve model interpretability. Furthermore, PIMP was used to correct RF-based importance measures for two real-world case studies. We propose an improved RF model that uses the significant variables with respect to the PIMP measure and show that its prediction accuracy is superior to that of other existing models.Availability: R code for the method presented in this article is available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/{$\sim$}altmann/download/PIMP.RContact: ~altmann@mpi-inf.mpg.de, laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad-hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is driving recent advances behind many everyday technologies, including speech and image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous driving. It is also gaining popularity in biology, where it has been used for automated species identification, environmental monitoring, ecological modelling, behavioural studies, DNA sequencing and population genetics and phylogenetics, among other applications. Deep learning relies on artificial neural networks for predictive modelling and excels at recognizing complex patterns. In this review we synthesize 818 studies using deep learning in the context of ecology and evolution to give a discipline-wide perspective necessary to promote a rethinking of inference approaches in the field. We provide an introduction to machine learning and contrast it with mechanistic inference, followed by a gentle primer on deep learning. We review the applications of deep learning in ecology and evolution and discuss its limitations and efforts to overcome them. We also provide a practical primer for biologists interested in including deep learning in their toolkit and identify its possible future applications. We find that deep learning is being rapidly adopted in ecology and evolution, with 589 studies (64\%) published since the beginning of 2019. Most use convolutional neural networks (496 studies) and supervised learning for image identification but also for tasks using molecular data, sounds, environmental data or video as input. More sophisticated uses of deep learning in biology are also beginning to appear. Operating within the machine learning paradigm, deep learning can be viewed as an alternative to mechanistic modelling. It has desirable properties of good performance and scaling with increasing complexity, while posing unique challenges such as sensitivity to bias in input data. We expect that rapid adoption of deep learning in ecology and evolution will continue, especially in automation of biodiversity monitoring and discovery and inference from genetic data. Increased use of unsupervised learning for discovery and visualization of clusters and gaps, simplification of multi-step analysis pipelines, and integration of machine learning into graduate and postgraduate training are all likely in the near future.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy.

  abstract = {Major levee repairs and emergency levee repairs within the Sacramento River system have been traditionally conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) through their Sacramento River Bank Protection Project (SRBPP), and the PL84-99 Rehabilitation Programs (Public Law 84-99, the Flood and Coastal Storm Emergencies Act). On February 24, 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a State of Emergency for California's levee system, releasing up to \$500 million to repair and evaluate State and Federal project levees. These levee repair funds were administered through the existing levee repair and rehabilitation programs and the former Sacramento-San Joaquin Erosion Repairs Project (SSJERP). The USACE is the lead agency for the SRBPP and the PL 84-99 Rehabilitation Program, while the California State Department of Water Resources (DWR) was the lead agency for the SSJERP. When the levees were originally constructed, maintained, and repaired (starting in the mid to late 19th century), mitigation measures were not required, but since the early 1990s, winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead (O. mykiss), and the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) in the Sacramento River have been listed under the state and federal Endangered Species Acts. As a result, mitigation measures to offset adverse effects associated with levee construction and repair were developed for the post-2006 levee repairs and were designed based on the Standardized Assessment Methodology (SAM; USACE 2004, 2006; USACE and CVFPB 2009). The SAM is a predictive model used to quantify potential impacts to threatened and endangered fish species due to construction of bank revetment and other bank protection measures, and can also be utilized to assess the fish habitat value of experimental mitigation and compensation measures. The SAM quantifies habitat values in terms of a bank line or area-weighted species response index; habitat variables include bank slope, floodplain inundation ratio, bank substrate size, instream structure, aquatic vegetation, and overhanging shade. Based on SAM results, four experimental levee repair designs were developed and constructed in the project area. For these post-2006 emergency levee repairs covered by the Governor's declaration, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued Biological Opinions (Opinion) pertaining to Chinook salmon and steelhead in June 2006 and August 2007, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued Opinions pertaining to delta smelt in June 2006 and April 2007. The NMFS and USFWS Opinions support approval of critical levee repairs at 54 sites (along the Sacramento and Bear rivers; and Steamboat, Sutter, and Cache sloughs). DWR undertook repairs at 27 of the sites, and the USACE undertook repairs at the remaining 27 sites. These sites were identified as ``critical,'' as defined by bank erosion that could threaten the structural integrity of the Sacramento River flood control system, and therefore required immediate work to prevent levee failure during the next flood (Ayres Associates 2007). The NMFS and USFWS Opinions also required post-construction monitoring to evaluate whether ``on-site compensations [at post-2006 emergency levee Repair Sites] are functioning in a manner that enhances habitat value and offset adverse bank protection effects'' (NMFS 2001, 2004, 2006a, 2006b, 2007; USFWS 2004a, 2004b, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c, 2007). A fish and habitat monitoring plan (Sacramento River Bank Protection Project Long-Term Aquatic Monitoring Program) was developed in 2008 (H.T. Harvey \& Associates et al. 2008) and revised in 2011 (FISHBIO 2011), which established monitoring goals and objectives, as well as monitoring protocols to meet the post-construction monitoring requirements of these Opinions. Annual baseline monitoring has been conducted since 2008, though scope and methodology of monitoring have varied since initial collection of habitat and fisheries data began. Initial efforts to adequately characterize fish community composition and habitat use at selected repair sites suffered from low catch rates (largely attributable to low capture success using traps; H.T. Harvey \& Associates and PRBO 2009), and the sampling methodology was subsequently revised to better document differences in abundance of focal fish species between different mitigated repair types, naturalized sites and unmitigated repair sites. Single pass boat-based electrofishing was determined to be the most effective way to sample fish at the selected monitoring sites, and was implemented in 2009 (considered the first year in the baseline dataset for long-term monitoring evaluations). Since then, the general approach to fish community sampling and subsequent data analysis has been relatively consistent, though minor adjustments to the selection of monitored sites and field sampling methodology have been made (outlined in detail in subsequent sections). This report documents and evaluates the results of the annual fish and habitat monitoring conducted in 2013, as well as comparisons to fish and habitat monitoring conducted from 2009- 2010 (H.T. Harvey \& Associates and PRBO 2011) and from 2011 to 2012 (FISHBIO 2012, 2013 cite both reports). In 2013, fish presence/abundance was evaluated at several site types by electrofishing, and concurrently collecting a variety of habitat features that may influence habitat occupancy by focal fish species (described in more detail below). Site types include post-2006 emergency levee repair sites that incorporate habitat mitigation features (Mitigated Repair Sites; n = 9); unmitigated pre-2006 levee repair sites consisting of rock revetment without additional habitat enhancement (Unmitigated Repair Sites; n = 3); and naturalized bank sites that have not been engineered, are not rip-rapped, and are dominated by native, naturally established vegetation (Naturalized Sites; n = 4). Through this monitoring effort, the following study objectives were addressed: 1) identify habitat features and design types of levee repair sites that promote use by focus species (anadromous salmonids), so that future repair sites may maximize benefits for species of concern, and 2) determine if focus fish species preferentially use Mitigated Repair Sites over unmitigated, or unimproved, levee repair sites. Key results of the 2013 monitoring effort: Fish community composition was nearly identical between mitigated repair sites (all design types combined) and Naturalized sites. Fish community composition was more dissimilar at unmitigated repair sites (compared to both, naturalized and mitigated repair sites). Among all different site types, the greatest difference in fish community composition was found between unmitigated repair sites and 10:1 Slope sites. Further, fish community composition was nearly identical between 10:1 Slope and naturalized sites. Probability of habitat occupancy of Chinook salmon fry was higher at most mitigated repair sites (except at Bench sites) compared to Unmitigated Repair Sites consisting primarily of rock revetment. This finding is consistent with results from the previous monitoring years. Of all sites types (including naturalized sites), probability of habitat use by Chinook salmon fry was highest at 10:1 Slope Sites. Nearshore current velocity is an important predictor of habitat use by Chinook salmon fry, and probability of occupancy decreases by about 80\% as current speed five feet from the bank increases from 0 -- 0.5 fps to 0.5 -- 1 fps. Higher temperatures at sampling points (compared to mid-channel surface temperature) significantly reduced probability of habitat occupancy by Chinook salmon fry and juvenile steelhead. Low levels of emergent vegetation increase probability of habitat use by Chinook salmon fry threefold. Low levels of emergent vegetation increase probability of habitat use by Chinook salmon juveniles by about 80\%. Probability of habitat use by juvenile steelhead is higher at nearshore habitats with a steep current gradient (high current velocity 15 feet from the bank) Black bass were most likely to be found at Bench and No Bench sites, with no differences in occupancy probability between unmitigated repair sites, 10:1 Slope sites and naturalized sites. Probability of encountering the species decreased by about 2\% per upstream rivermile within the surveyed reach. Habitat occupancy of Sacramento pikeminnow was most likely at shaded locations, and probability of encountering the species increased by about 2\% per upstream rivermile within the surveyed reach.},

  abstract = {Large-scale ecosystem restoration projects seldom undergo comprehensive evaluation to determine project effectiveness. Consequently, there are missed opportunities for learning and strategy refinement. Before our study, monitoring information from California's middle Sacramento River had not been synthesized, despite restoration having been ongoing since 1989. Our assessment was based on the development and application of 36 quantitative ecological indicators. These indicators were used to characterize the status of terrestrial and floodplain resources (e.g., flora and fauna), channel dynamics (e.g., planform, geomorphology), and the flow regime. Indicators were also associated with specific goal statements of the CALFED Ecosystem Restoration Program. A collective weight of evidence approach was used to assess restoration success. Our synthesis demonstrates good progress in the restoration of riparian habitats, birds and other wildlife, but not in restoration of streamflows and geomorphic processes. For example, from 1999 to 2007, there was a \&gt; 600\% increase in forest patch core size, and a 43\% increase in the area of the river bordered by natural habitat \&gt; 500 m wide. Species richness of landbirds and beetles increased at restoration sites, as did detections of bats. However, degraded post-Shasta Dam streamflow conditions continued. Relative to pre-dam conditions, the average number of years that pass between flows that are sufficient to mobilize the bed, and those that are of sufficient magnitude to inundate the floodplain, increased by over 100\%. Trends in geomorphic processes were strongly negative, with increases in the amount of bank hardened with riprap, and decreases in the area of floodplain reworked. Overall the channel simplified, becoming less sinuous with reduced overall channel length. Our progress assessment presents a compelling case for what needs to be done to further advance the ecological restoration of the river.

  abstract = {The deep learning (DL) revolution is touching all scientific disciplines and corners of our lives as a means of harnessing the power of big data. Marine ecology is no exception. New methods provide analysis of data from sensors, cameras, and acoustic recorders, even in real time, in ways that are reproducible and rapid. Off-the-shelf algorithms find, count, and classify species from digital images or video and detect cryptic patterns in noisy data. These endeavours require collaboration across ecological and data science disciplines, which can be challenging to initiate. To promote the use of DL towards ecosystem-based management of the sea, this paper aims to bridge the gap between marine ecologists and computer scientists. We provide insight into popular DL approaches for ecological data analysis, focusing on supervised learning techniques with deep neural networks, and illustrate challenges and opportunities through established and emerging applications of DL to marine ecology. We present case studies on plankton, fish, marine mammals, pollution, and nutrient cycling that involve object detection, classification, tracking, and segmentation of visualized data. We conclude with a broad outlook of the field's opportunities and challenges, including potential technological advances and issues with managing complex data sets.},

They influence local environments and biotas, determine related ecosystem processes and functions, and are associated with high levels of biodiversity. However, the intrinsic characteristics of megafauna species including long lifespan, large body size, sparseness and/or rarity, late maturity, and low fecundity, as well as high market value, make them very prone to extinction. Up to now, scientific interest and conservation efforts have mainly focused on terrestrial and marine megafauna, while freshwater species have received comparatively little attention, despite evidence suggesting that freshwaters are losing species faster than marine or terrestrial realms. The high susceptibility of freshwater megafauna to multiple threats, coupled with immense human pressure on freshwater ecosystems, places freshwater megafauna amongst the most threatened species globally. The main threats include overexploitation, dam construction, habitat degradation, pollution, and species invasion. These threats increase mortality, decrease productivity, and reduce fitness, causing the decline of populations and the extinction of freshwater megafauna species. Given the essential ecological and biological roles of freshwater megafauna, further research should focus on their distribution patterns, extinction risks, and population dynamics, thereby improving the knowledge base for conservation planning. Finally, freshwater megafauna-based conservation strategies may raise public awareness for freshwater conservation and therefore benefit a broader range of freshwater species and functions.

By contrast, antipredator responses to the chemical cues of smallmouth bass did not differ from controls. 4.These results were supported by similar differences in recognition of these predator odours by groups of juvenile Chinook salmon in fully natural conditions, though responses reflected a greater range of antipredator behaviours by individuals. In field trials, responses to northern pikeminnow odour resulted in increased flight or absence, reductions in swimming and foraging, and increased time spent near the substratum, compared to smallmouth bass odour. 5.Given that survival of juvenile fish is facilitated by predator recognition, our results support the hypothesis that naivety may be an important factor determining the effect of non-native predators on prey populations. Efforts to manage the effect of native and non-native predators may benefit by considering complex behavioural interactions, such as these at the individual and group levels. {\copyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Unfortunately, this process can be time consuming. However, the model tuning process can be streamlined by adaptively resampling candidate values so that settings that are clearly sub-optimal can be discarded. The notion of futility analysis is introduced in this context. An example is shown that illustrates how adaptive resampling can be used to reduce training time.

Winter-run chinook salmon extinction and recovery probabilities under, different future striped bass abundance levels were estimated by simulating from the posterior distribution of model parameters. The model predicts that if the striped bass population declines to 512,000 adults as expected in the absence of stocking, winter-run chinook salmon will have about a 28\% chance of quasi-extinction (defined as three consecutive spawning runs of fewer than 200 adults) within 50 years. If stocking stabilizes the striped bass population at 700,000 adults, the predicted quasi-extinction probability is 30\%. A more ambitious stocking program that maintains a population of 3 million adult striped bass would increase the predicted quasi-extinction probability to 55\%. Extinction probability, but not recovery probability, was fairly insensitive to assumptions about density dependence. We conclude that winter-run chinook salmon face a serious extinction risk without augmentation of the striped bass population and that substantial increases in striped bass abundance could significantly increase the threat to winter-run chinook salmon if not mitigated by increasing winter chinook salmon survival in some other way.},

Despite extensive societal investments in salmon habitat restoration in recent years, the role of pesticides as a limiting factor for salmon recovery has received little attention. Pesticides can be toxic to primary producers and macroinvertebrates, thereby limiting salmon population recovery through adverse, bottom-up impacts on aquatic food webs. The integration of toxicology, environmental chemistry, population biology, community ecology, landscape ecology, conservation biology, and environmental policy is needed to better understand these indirect effects of pesticides on endangered species.

To monitor the temporal and spatial trends of this rich fish community, long-term fish monitoring programs within the estuary use a variety of gear types to capture fish species across life stages and habitats. However, concerns have been raised that current sampling gears may fail to detect certain species---or life stages---that inhabit areas that are not accessible by current gear types (e.g., riprap banks, shallow vegetated areas). Boat electrofishing is one sampling method that has been proposed to supplement current long-term fish monitoring in the upper estuary. In this study, we used fish catch data from past boat electrofishing studies, a long-term beach seine survey, and a couple of long-running trawl surveys to compare the relative probability of detecting various fishes across these sampling gears. Overall, we found that boat electrofishing led to notable improvements in the detection rates for many native and non-native fishes we examined. Boat electrofishing gear was better at detecting the majority of species in the spring (20 out of 38 species, 53\%) and fall-winter (24 out of 34 species, 70\%) sampling periods. Based on these findings, we recommend that resource managers consider the implementation of a long-term boat electrofishing survey to help them in their long-term conservation planning for fishes within the upper estuary.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance of stream ecosystems, often chronic in nature, has been studied extensively. However, when disturbance is driven by more than one resource policy over many decades, feedback between habitat evolution and biological adaptation can be disrupted and ecological function affected in unforeseen ways. We analyzed over 100 years of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) length frequency trends associated with fisheries management and changes in available spawning substrate (habitat) linked to flow regulation in a highly altered California river. Over time, salmon lengths generally decreased, fluctuating with exploitation (ocean harvest) and hatchery production rates. Female size reduction, coupled with a degrading and coarsening channel, and perching peripheral habitat related to past mining activity, indicates available spawning substrate may be too large to support the current salmon population. Assuming a salmon can move material 10\% of her body length, length frequency data and current substrate size distribution suggest that increasing salmon sizes to historic distributions could increase available spawning habitat by as much as 13\%. Alternatively, decreasing spawning substrate size could support a greater portion of the current population. To test the latter hypothesis and inform future management actions, we monitored two spawning riffles where large and small gravel was placed on top of a cobble. We observed an immediate spawning activity increase that was more pronounced where smaller gravel was deposited. Following a decade of habitat decline, the two sites were both replenished with medium gravel. Elevated spawning use occurred immediately at both sites, commensurate with this intermediate size, further supporting our hypotheses. Sediment coarsening and habitat disconnect below dams, combined with reduced salmon size, indicate the natural spawning process may be decoupled from available habitat below dams in the foreseeable future without continuous intervention. Actively managing salmon population demographics through modified hatchery and size-selective harvest practices and developing a coarse sediment budget with size-appropriate material for regulated anadromous rivers could produce immediate benefits for ecosystem services, including salmon populations. However, these management actions will require continued maintenance and informed socio-ecological goals to remain successful.},

Understanding the diets of salmonid predators is critical to understanding their individual effects, role in the food web, and the implications for potential management actions. We collected the stomach contents of Striped Bass Morone saxatilis, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and White Catfish Ameiurus catus sampled from three 1-km reaches in the lower San Joaquin River in 2014 and 2015 during the peak juvenile salmon out-migration period. Using a genetic barcoding technique, we tested each stomach (n = 582) for the presence of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other prey items. Channel Catfish had significantly higher frequency of Chinook Salmon in their stomachs (27.8\% of tested Channel Catfish contained Chinook Salmon DNA), compared to the other three predators (2.8\% to 4.8\%). However, non-native fish species occurred at greater frequencies than salmon in the diets of all four predator species. Using depletion estimation from electrofishing, we were able to generate population densities for Striped Bass and Largemouth Bass in our reaches. Largemouth Bass were evenly distributed throughout all three reaches, at a mean density of approximately 333 ({\textpm} 195 SE) per km of river. Striped Bass were patchily distributed, ranging from 21 to 1,227 per km. Extrapolating the frequency of salmon detected in stomachs to the predator abundance estimates, we estimate that the population of Largemouth Bass we sampled consumed between 3 and 5 Chinook Salmon per day per 1-km study reach (consumption rate of 0.011 salmon per predator per day), whereas the Striped Bass population consumed between 0 and 24 Chinook Salmon per day (0.019 salmon per predator per day).},

  abstract = {People seek reliable natural resources despite climate change. Diverse habitats and biologies stabilize productivity against disturbances like climate, prompting arguments to promote climate-resilient resources by prioritizing complex, less-modified ecosystems. These arguments hinge on the hypothesis that simplifying and degrading ecosystems will reduce resources' climate resilience, a process liable to be cryptically evolving across landscapes and human generations, but rarely documented. Here, we examined the industrial era (post 1848) of California's Central Valley, chronicling the decline of a diversified, functional portfolio of salmon habitats and life histories and investigating for empirical evidence of lost climate resilience in its fishery. Present perspectives indicate that California's dynamic, warming climate overlaid onto its truncated, degraded habitat mosaic severely constrains its salmon fishery. We indeed found substantial climate constraints on today's fishery, but this reflected a shifted ecological baseline. During the early stages of a stressor legacy that transformed the landscape and -- often consequently -- compressed salmon life history expression, the fishery diffused impacts of dry years across a greater number of fishing years and depended less on cool spring-summer transitions. The latter are important given today's salmon habitats, salmon life histories, and resource management practices, but are vanishing with climate change while year-to-year variation in fishery performance is rising. These findings give empirical weight to the idea that human legacies influence ecosystems' climate resilience across landscapes and boundaries (e.g., land/sea). They also raise the question of whether some contemporary climate effects are recent and attributable not only to increasing climate stress, but to past and present human actions that erode resilience. In general, it is thus worth considering that management approaches that prioritize complex, less-modified ecosystems may stabilize productivity despite increasing climate stress and such protective actions may be required for some ecological services to persist into uncertain climate futures.},

  abstract = {The popularity of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools remains debated. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, failing to synthesise the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL, starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact ecological data analysis in the future. We conclude that ML and DL are powerful new tools for predictive modelling and data analysis. The superior performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an indispensable tool in ecology and evolution, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.},

  abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

  abstract = {Human demands on the world's available freshwater supplies continue to grow as the global population increases. In the endeavor to manage water to meet human needs, the needs of freshwater species and ecosystems have largely been neglected, and the ecological consequences have been tragic. Healthy freshwater ecosystems provide a wealth of goods and services for society, but our appropriation of freshwater flows must be better managed if we hope to sustain these benefits and freshwater biodiversity. We offer a framework for developing an ecologically sustainable water management program, in which human needs for water are met by storing and diverting water in a manner that can sustain or restore the ecological integrity of affected river ecosystems. Our six-step process includes: (1) developing initial numerical estimates of key aspects of river flow necessary to sustain native species and natural ecosystem functions; (2) accounting for human uses of water, both current and future, through development of a computerized hydrologic simulation model that facilitates examination of human-induced alterations to river flow regimes; (3) assessing incompatibilities between human and ecosystem needs with particular attention to their spatial and temporal character; (4) collaboratively searching for solutions to resolve incompatibilities; (5) conducting water management experiments to resolve critical uncertainties that frustrate efforts to integrate human and ecosystem needs; and (6) designing and implementing an adaptive management program to facilitate ecologically sustainable water management for the long term. Drawing from case studies around the world to illustrate our framework, we suggest that ecologically sustainable water management is attainable in the vast majority of the world's river basins. However, this quest will become far less feasible if we wait until water supplies are further over-appropriated.},

Thanks to the increase in the amount of data and computing power available, it has become pervasive across scientific disciplines. We first highlight why machine learning is needed in marine ecology. Then we provide a quick primer on machine learning techniques and vocabulary. We built a database of {$\sim$}1000 publications that implement such techniques to analyse marine ecology data. For various data types (images, optical spectra, acoustics, omics, geolocations, biogeochemical profiles, and satellite imagery), we present a historical perspective on applications that proved influential, can serve as templates for new work, or represent the diversity of approaches. Then, we illustrate how machine learning can be used to better understand ecological systems, by combining various sources of marine data. Through this coverage of the literature, we demonstrate an increase in the proportion of marine ecology studies that use machine learning, the pervasiveness of images as a data source, the dominance of machine learning for classification-type problems, and a shift towards deep learning for all data types. This overview is meant to guide researchers who wish to apply machine learning methods to their marine datasets.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

Additionally, synergistic effects of multiple anthropogenic modifications, including species introductions and habitat alterations, can have complex outcomes for native species. We assessed how a nonnative predator (the Striped Bass Morone saxatilis) and habitat alterations (a small diversion dam and other altered habitats) interacted to influence mortality of native juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha during their emigration from the lower Mokelumne River, California. Relative abundance and diet surveys across natural and human-altered habitats were used to assess Striped Bass functional and aggregative responses. Per capita consumption (PCC) of juvenile salmon and behavioral aggregation (CPUE) by Striped Bass at a small diversion dam (Woodbridge Irrigation District Dam [WIDD]) were elevated in comparison with those at other altered and natural habitats (WIDD: PCC = 3.54 juvenile salmon, CPUE = 0.189 Striped Bass/s of electrofishing; other altered habitats: PCC = 0 juvenile salmon, CPUE = 0.0024 Striped Bass/s; natural habitats: PCC = not estimable, CPUE = 0.0003 Striped Bass/s). Increased aggregative and functional predator responses created a localized area of heightened predation at WIDD. At this predation hot spot, we used three approaches (experimental Striped Bass removals, diet energetic analysis, and before--after impact assessment) to estimate Striped Bass consumption at 8--29\% of the emigrating juvenile salmon population. Striped Bass PCC rates for juvenile salmon as determined by the three approaches were 0.92\% (predator removals), 0.71--1.20\% (diet energetic analysis), and 0.96--1.11\% (before--after impact assessment). Our results (1) illustrate how the synergistic effect of habitat modification and a nonnative predator can exacerbate the mortality of native juvenile salmon during their emigration and (2) highlight the importance of considering interactions among stressors when planning local management strategies and assessing population-level impacts on salmon.

The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application.},

Explainable AI approaches to trace human-interpretable decision processes from algorithms have been explored. Yet, little is known about algorithmic explainability from a human factors' perspective. From the perspective of user interpretability and understandability, this study examines the effect of explainability in AI on user trust and attitudes toward AI. It conceptualizes causability as an antecedent of explainability and as a key cue of an algorithm and examines them in relation to trust by testing how they affect user perceived performance of AI-driven services. The results show the dual roles of causability and explainability in terms of its underlying links to trust and subsequent user behaviors. Explanations of why certain news articles are recommended generate users trust whereas causability of to what extent they can understand the explanations affords users emotional confidence. Causability lends the justification for what and how should be explained as it determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability. The results have implications for the inclusion of causability and explanatory cues in AI systems, which help to increase trust and help users to assess the quality of explanations. Causable explainable AI will help people understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms by bringing transparency and accountability into AI systems.},

We assessed the rationale for breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams to prevent complete loss of these fishes, and to maximize their likelihood of recovery. We summarize the science surrounding Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), Chinook Salmon (O.~tshawytscha), steelhead (O.~mykiss), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). From this, we drew ten conclusions: (1) development of the Columbia River System (including the Snake River Basin) has converted mainstem rivers into reservoirs, altering fish behavior and survival; (2) most populations currently record their lowest abundance; (3) the Columbia River System dams reduce productivity of diadromous fishes in the highest-quality spawning grounds that could buffer against future climate dynamics; (4) past actions have done little to reduce impacts or precipitate recovery; (5) the Columbia River System constrains survival and productivity of salmon, steelhead and Bull Trout; (6) Snake River Basin salmon and steelhead remain at high extinction risk; (7) eliminating migration impediments and improving mainstem habitats are essential for maintaining genetic diversity and improving Bull Trout persistence; (8) the lower Snake River Basin dams preclude passage of adult White Sturgeon, constraining gene flow and recruitment; (9) the lower Snake River Basin dams impede dramatically passage of adult and juvenile Pacific Lamprey, and (10) Snake River Basin Pacific Lamprey is at high risk of extirpation. Breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams is an action likely to prevent extirpation and extinction of these fishes.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n\,=\,490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12\,min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.},

  abstract = {The human footprint is now large in all the Earth's ecosystems, and construction of large dams in major river basins is among the anthropogenic changes that have had the most profound ecological consequences, particularly for migratory fishes. In the Columbia River basin of the western USA, considerable effort has been directed toward evaluating demographic effects of dams, yet little attention has been paid to evolutionary responses of migratory salmon to altered selective regimes. Here we make a first attempt to address this information gap. Transformation of the free-flowing Columbia River into a series of slack-water reservoirs has relaxed selection for adults capable of migrating long distances upstream against strong flows; conditions now favour fish capable of migrating through lakes and finding and navigating fish ladders. Juveniles must now be capable of surviving passage through multiple dams or collection and transportation around the dams. River flow patterns deliver some groups of juvenile salmon to the estuary later than is optimal for ocean survival, but countervailing selective pressures might constrain an evolutionary response toward earlier migration timing. Dams have increased the cost of migration, which reduces energy available for sexual selection and favours a nonmigratory life history. Reservoirs are a benign environment for many non-native species that are competitors with or predators on salmon, and evolutionary responses are likely (but undocumented). More research is needed to tease apart the relative importance of evolutionary vs. plastic responses of salmon to these environmental changes; this research is logistically challenging for species with life histories like Pacific salmon, but results should substantially improve our understanding of key processes. If the Columbia River is ever returned to a quasinatural, free-flowing state, remaining populations might face a Darwinian debt (and temporarily reduced fitness) as they struggle to re-evolve historical adaptations.},

This was the first such attempt to quantify the predatory impacts of M. dolomieu within this region. The Rondegat River is home to five species of indigenous fish and is partially invaded by M. dolomieu, which has penetrated the lower river up to a waterfall barrier. Seasonal surveys were conducted at five sites above, and five below, the waterfall. Physical habitat was measured at each site. Four of the five indigenous fish species were absent at bass-invaded sites. Labeobarbus capensis (Smith), while still present below the waterfall, appeared to have suffered a near-total loss of post-spawning recruits. Analyses of physical habitat quality failed to explain the loss of indigenous fish below the waterfall, although sedimentation may have increased the vulnerability of the catfish Austroglanis gilli (Barnard) to M. dolomieu predation by obliterating benthic cover. Consequently, predation by M. dolomieu was presumed to be the critical mechanism explaining the loss of indigenous fishes in the lower Rondegat River. Copyright {\copyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Central Valley drainage of California formerly produced immense numbers of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Four seasonal runs occur in this system---fall, latefall, winter, and spring runs. Differences in life history timing and spatial distribution enabled the four runs to use the drainage to the fullest possible extent and once made it one of the richest regions in the world for chinook salmon production. Native American fishers within the Central Valley drainage harvested chinook salmon at estimated levels that reached 8.5 million pounds or more annually. Native harvests, therefore, were roughly comparable to the peak commercial harvests taken later by Euro-American fishers, but whether or not native fishing depressed the productive capacities of the salmon populations to any substantial degree is not known. The commercial chinook salmon fishery in California started about 1850 in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento--San Joaquin Delta region, where it formed the nucleus of the first major fishery conducted by Euro-American immigrants in the state. This fishery was one of the important early industries that supported the Euro-American settlement of the Central Valley region. The salmon fishery remained centered there until the early 1900s, when ocean salmon fishing began to expand and eventually came to dominate the fishery. Annual catches by the early Sacramento--San Joaquin in-river fishery commonly reached 4--10 million pounds and generally were higher than the total statewide catches made during the most recent several decades. The historical abundances of Central Valley chinook salmon before large-scale commercial exploitation and depletion of the runs cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of early commercial catch records, the maximal production levels of the Central Valley chinook salmon stocks in aggregate may be conservatively estimated to have reached approximately 1--2 million spawners annually. Although substantial investment has been made by the state of California in managing the chinook salmon resource since the early years of the commercial fishery, chinook salmon have declined over the decades to small fractions of their previous numbers. The decline of the Central Valley chinook salmon resource was caused by several factors: overfishing, blockage and degradation of streams by mining activities, and reduction of salmon habitat and streamflows by dams and water diversions. Differences between the four chinook salmon runs in life history timing and habitat requirements partly account for their different population histories; the winter run is now threatened with extinction, the spring run recently has approached a similarly imperiled state, and the late-fall run has been at moderately low population levels for the past two decades. Only the fall run, in aggregate, can be regarded as secure, but it too has undergone substantial reductions in abundance. Fall-run spawner numbers were especially low in the San Joaquin River basin in recent years, and in Sacramento River basin streams their numbers have been heavily influenced by production of hatchery fish.},

  abstract = {Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) formerly occurred in great abundance within the California Central Valley drainage and were a correspondingly important part of the subsistence economics and cultures of the indigenous peoples of that region. Salmon and other fishery resources on the Central Valley floor were part of a resource base that enabled resident Native American groups to attain some of the highest population densities to occur among the non-agricultural native societies of North America. Indirect estimates of aboriginal harvests prior to Euro-American settlement of the region indicate that the native fishers may have exploited the Central Valley salmon resource on a level comparable to that later attained by the immigrant Euro-American fishers of the late ninteenth century commercial fishery. The salmon resource also figured, to varying degrees, in native interactions--- from trade item to causa belli. Among the last intact native groups in California reliant on a salmon-based subsistence economy were the McCloud River Wintu---a people who were instrumental in the successful operation of the U.S. Fish Commission egg-collecting station on the lower McCloud River that supplied salmon eggs for shipments to U.S. Eastern states and overseas countries. Prior to 1850, mention of salmon was made perodically by Spanish chroniclers and by European and (U.S.) American observers who traveled through the region. Sustained harvests of salmon by Euro-Americans did not begin until the California Gold Rush period, starting in 1848. The commercial salmon fishery of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and Delta region was one of the earliest major industries of California during the period of (U.S.) American settlement. The fishery frequently attained harvest levels of 4 to 10 million pounds (1.8 to 4.5 million kg) per year during the highly productive early decades of operation (1870s to 1900s), and it contributed substantially to the regional economy. Despite the general decline of Pacific salmon resources in California and the Pacific Northwest region since the early period of commercial exploitation, chinook salmon have continued to contribute significantly to the state and local economies in recent decades. Aside from its importance as a food commodity, other aspects of the value of the salmon resource (viz., biological, recreational, and aesthetic benefits) are being increasingly recognized. The chinook salmon resource of the California Central Valley --- having provided material and amenity benefits to both native and immigrant peoples for so long in the past --- may yet continue to fulfill the needs of humans in the future if we of the present make it so.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{$\gg$}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},
