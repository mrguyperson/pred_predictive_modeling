  abstract = {Inland waters have received only slight consideration in recent discussions of the global fisheries crisis, even though inland fisheries provide much-needed protein, jobs, and income, especially in poor rural communities of developing countries. Systematic overfishing of fresh waters is largely unrecognized because of weak reporting and because fishery declines take place within a complex of other pressures. Moreover, the ecosystem consequences of changes to the species, size, and trophic composition of fish assemblages are poorly understood. These complexities underlie the paradox that overexploitation of a fishery may not be marked by declines in total yield, even when individual species and long-term sustainability are highly threatened. Indeed, one of the symptoms of intense fishing in inland waters is the collapse of particular stocks even as overall fish production rises---a biodiversity crisis more than a fisheries crisis.},

  abstract = {Charismatic megafauna species may act as both flagship and umbrella species. They influence local environments and biotas, determine related ecosystem processes and functions, and are associated with high levels of biodiversity. However, the intrinsic characteristics of megafauna species including long lifespan, large body size, sparseness and/or rarity, late maturity, and low fecundity, as well as high market value, make them very prone to extinction. Up to now, scientific interest and conservation efforts have mainly focused on terrestrial and marine megafauna, while freshwater species have received comparatively little attention, despite evidence suggesting that freshwaters are losing species faster than marine or terrestrial realms. The high susceptibility of freshwater megafauna to multiple threats, coupled with immense human pressure on freshwater ecosystems, places freshwater megafauna amongst the most threatened species globally. The main threats include overexploitation, dam construction, habitat degradation, pollution, and species invasion. These threats increase mortality, decrease productivity, and reduce fitness, causing the decline of populations and the extinction of freshwater megafauna species. Given the essential ecological and biological roles of freshwater megafauna, further research should focus on their distribution patterns, extinction risks, and population dynamics, thereby improving the knowledge base for conservation planning. Finally, freshwater megafauna-based conservation strategies may raise public awareness for freshwater conservation and therefore benefit a broader range of freshwater species and functions.

By contrast, antipredator responses to the chemical cues of smallmouth bass did not differ from controls. 4.These results were supported by similar differences in recognition of these predator odours by groups of juvenile Chinook salmon in fully natural conditions, though responses reflected a greater range of antipredator behaviours by individuals. In field trials, responses to northern pikeminnow odour resulted in increased flight or absence, reductions in swimming and foraging, and increased time spent near the substratum, compared to smallmouth bass odour. 5.Given that survival of juvenile fish is facilitated by predator recognition, our results support the hypothesis that naivety may be an important factor determining the effect of non-native predators on prey populations. Efforts to manage the effect of native and non-native predators may benefit by considering complex behavioural interactions, such as these at the individual and group levels. {\copyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In the western US, pesticides have contaminated many surface waters that provide habitat for endangered salmon. These iconic species depend on the productivity of rivers, lakes, and estuaries to provide food for juvenile growth, a key determinant of subsequent marine survival. Despite extensive societal investments in salmon habitat restoration in recent years, the role of pesticides as a limiting factor for salmon recovery has received little attention. Pesticides can be toxic to primary producers and macroinvertebrates, thereby limiting salmon population recovery through adverse, bottom-up impacts on aquatic food webs. The integration of toxicology, environmental chemistry, population biology, community ecology, landscape ecology, conservation biology, and environmental policy is needed to better understand these indirect effects of pesticides on endangered species. We highlight key information gaps and discuss how future research on pesticides and food webs can most effectively guide the long-term conservation of imperiled fish species.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance of stream ecosystems, often chronic in nature, has been studied extensively. However, when disturbance is driven by more than one resource policy over many decades, feedback between habitat evolution and biological adaptation can be disrupted and ecological function affected in unforeseen ways. We analyzed over 100 years of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) length frequency trends associated with fisheries management and changes in available spawning substrate (habitat) linked to flow regulation in a highly altered California river. Over time, salmon lengths generally decreased, fluctuating with exploitation (ocean harvest) and hatchery production rates. Female size reduction, coupled with a degrading and coarsening channel, and perching peripheral habitat related to past mining activity, indicates available spawning substrate may be too large to support the current salmon population. Assuming a salmon can move material 10\% of her body length, length frequency data and current substrate size distribution suggest that increasing salmon sizes to historic distributions could increase available spawning habitat by as much as 13\%. Alternatively, decreasing spawning substrate size could support a greater portion of the current population. To test the latter hypothesis and inform future management actions, we monitored two spawning riffles where large and small gravel was placed on top of a cobble. We observed an immediate spawning activity increase that was more pronounced where smaller gravel was deposited. Following a decade of habitat decline, the two sites were both replenished with medium gravel. Elevated spawning use occurred immediately at both sites, commensurate with this intermediate size, further supporting our hypotheses. Sediment coarsening and habitat disconnect below dams, combined with reduced salmon size, indicate the natural spawning process may be decoupled from available habitat below dams in the foreseeable future without continuous intervention. Actively managing salmon population demographics through modified hatchery and size-selective harvest practices and developing a coarse sediment budget with size-appropriate material for regulated anadromous rivers could produce immediate benefits for ecosystem services, including salmon populations. However, these management actions will require continued maintenance and informed socio-ecological goals to remain successful.},

Understanding the diets of salmonid predators is critical to understanding their individual effects, role in the food web, and the implications for potential management actions. We collected the stomach contents of Striped Bass Morone saxatilis, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and White Catfish Ameiurus catus sampled from three 1-km reaches in the lower San Joaquin River in 2014 and 2015 during the peak juvenile salmon out-migration period. Using a genetic barcoding technique, we tested each stomach (n = 582) for the presence of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other prey items. Channel Catfish had significantly higher frequency of Chinook Salmon in their stomachs (27.8\% of tested Channel Catfish contained Chinook Salmon DNA), compared to the other three predators (2.8\% to 4.8\%). However, non-native fish species occurred at greater frequencies than salmon in the diets of all four predator species. Using depletion estimation from electrofishing, we were able to generate population densities for Striped Bass and Largemouth Bass in our reaches. Largemouth Bass were evenly distributed throughout all three reaches, at a mean density of approximately 333 ({\textpm} 195 SE) per km of river. Striped Bass were patchily distributed, ranging from 21 to 1,227 per km. Extrapolating the frequency of salmon detected in stomachs to the predator abundance estimates, we estimate that the population of Largemouth Bass we sampled consumed between 3 and 5 Chinook Salmon per day per 1-km study reach (consumption rate of 0.011 salmon per predator per day), whereas the Striped Bass population consumed between 0 and 24 Chinook Salmon per day (0.019 salmon per predator per day).},

  abstract = {People seek reliable natural resources despite climate change. Diverse habitats and biologies stabilize productivity against disturbances like climate, prompting arguments to promote climate-resilient resources by prioritizing complex, less-modified ecosystems. These arguments hinge on the hypothesis that simplifying and degrading ecosystems will reduce resources' climate resilience, a process liable to be cryptically evolving across landscapes and human generations, but rarely documented. Here, we examined the industrial era (post 1848) of California's Central Valley, chronicling the decline of a diversified, functional portfolio of salmon habitats and life histories and investigating for empirical evidence of lost climate resilience in its fishery. Present perspectives indicate that California's dynamic, warming climate overlaid onto its truncated, degraded habitat mosaic severely constrains its salmon fishery. We indeed found substantial climate constraints on today's fishery, but this reflected a shifted ecological baseline. During the early stages of a stressor legacy that transformed the landscape and -- often consequently -- compressed salmon life history expression, the fishery diffused impacts of dry years across a greater number of fishing years and depended less on cool spring-summer transitions. The latter are important given today's salmon habitats, salmon life histories, and resource management practices, but are vanishing with climate change while year-to-year variation in fishery performance is rising. These findings give empirical weight to the idea that human legacies influence ecosystems' climate resilience across landscapes and boundaries (e.g., land/sea). They also raise the question of whether some contemporary climate effects are recent and attributable not only to increasing climate stress, but to past and present human actions that erode resilience. In general, it is thus worth considering that management approaches that prioritize complex, less-modified ecosystems may stabilize productivity despite increasing climate stress and such protective actions may be required for some ecological services to persist into uncertain climate futures.},

  abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

  abstract = {Human demands on the world's available freshwater supplies continue to grow as the global population increases. In the endeavor to manage water to meet human needs, the needs of freshwater species and ecosystems have largely been neglected, and the ecological consequences have been tragic. Healthy freshwater ecosystems provide a wealth of goods and services for society, but our appropriation of freshwater flows must be better managed if we hope to sustain these benefits and freshwater biodiversity. We offer a framework for developing an ecologically sustainable water management program, in which human needs for water are met by storing and diverting water in a manner that can sustain or restore the ecological integrity of affected river ecosystems. Our six-step process includes: (1) developing initial numerical estimates of key aspects of river flow necessary to sustain native species and natural ecosystem functions; (2) accounting for human uses of water, both current and future, through development of a computerized hydrologic simulation model that facilitates examination of human-induced alterations to river flow regimes; (3) assessing incompatibilities between human and ecosystem needs with particular attention to their spatial and temporal character; (4) collaboratively searching for solutions to resolve incompatibilities; (5) conducting water management experiments to resolve critical uncertainties that frustrate efforts to integrate human and ecosystem needs; and (6) designing and implementing an adaptive management program to facilitate ecologically sustainable water management for the long term. Drawing from case studies around the world to illustrate our framework, we suggest that ecologically sustainable water management is attainable in the vast majority of the world's river basins. However, this quest will become far less feasible if we wait until water supplies are further over-appropriated.},

From this, we drew ten conclusions: (1) development of the Columbia River System (including the Snake River Basin) has converted mainstem rivers into reservoirs, altering fish behavior and survival; (2) most populations currently record their lowest abundance; (3) the Columbia River System dams reduce productivity of diadromous fishes in the highest-quality spawning grounds that could buffer against future climate dynamics; (4) past actions have done little to reduce impacts or precipitate recovery; (5) the Columbia River System constrains survival and productivity of salmon, steelhead and Bull Trout; (6) Snake River Basin salmon and steelhead remain at high extinction risk; (7) eliminating migration impediments and improving mainstem habitats are essential for maintaining genetic diversity and improving Bull Trout persistence; (8) the lower Snake River Basin dams preclude passage of adult White Sturgeon, constraining gene flow and recruitment; (9) the lower Snake River Basin dams impede dramatically passage of adult and juvenile Pacific Lamprey, and (10) Snake River Basin Pacific Lamprey is at high risk of extirpation. Breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams is an action likely to prevent extirpation and extinction of these fishes.

Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n\,=\,490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12\,min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.},

Many North American species are critically endangered, and entire populations have been lost. Major factors driving declines include overfishing, pollution, water withdrawals, aquaculture, non-native species, habitat degradation, over-zealous application of hatcheries designed to mitigate effects of other factors, and effects of climate change. Perhaps, the most broadly tractable and effective factors affecting diadromous fishes are removals of the dams that prevent or hinder their migrations, alter their environment, and often favor non-native biotic communities. Future survival of many diadromous fish populations may depend on this.},

  abstract = {The human footprint is now large in all the Earth's ecosystems, and construction of large dams in major river basins is among the anthropogenic changes that have had the most profound ecological consequences, particularly for migratory fishes. In the Columbia River basin of the western USA, considerable effort has been directed toward evaluating demographic effects of dams, yet little attention has been paid to evolutionary responses of migratory salmon to altered selective regimes. Here we make a first attempt to address this information gap. Transformation of the free-flowing Columbia River into a series of slack-water reservoirs has relaxed selection for adults capable of migrating long distances upstream against strong flows; conditions now favour fish capable of migrating through lakes and finding and navigating fish ladders. Juveniles must now be capable of surviving passage through multiple dams or collection and transportation around the dams. River flow patterns deliver some groups of juvenile salmon to the estuary later than is optimal for ocean survival, but countervailing selective pressures might constrain an evolutionary response toward earlier migration timing. Dams have increased the cost of migration, which reduces energy available for sexual selection and favours a nonmigratory life history. Reservoirs are a benign environment for many non-native species that are competitors with or predators on salmon, and evolutionary responses are likely (but undocumented). More research is needed to tease apart the relative importance of evolutionary vs. plastic responses of salmon to these environmental changes; this research is logistically challenging for species with life histories like Pacific salmon, but results should substantially improve our understanding of key processes. If the Columbia River is ever returned to a quasinatural, free-flowing state, remaining populations might face a Darwinian debt (and temporarily reduced fitness) as they struggle to re-evolve historical adaptations.},

This was the first such attempt to quantify the predatory impacts of M. dolomieu within this region. The Rondegat River is home to five species of indigenous fish and is partially invaded by M. dolomieu, which has penetrated the lower river up to a waterfall barrier. Seasonal surveys were conducted at five sites above, and five below, the waterfall. Physical habitat was measured at each site. Four of the five indigenous fish species were absent at bass-invaded sites. Labeobarbus capensis (Smith), while still present below the waterfall, appeared to have suffered a near-total loss of post-spawning recruits. Analyses of physical habitat quality failed to explain the loss of indigenous fish below the waterfall, although sedimentation may have increased the vulnerability of the catfish Austroglanis gilli (Barnard) to M. dolomieu predation by obliterating benthic cover. Consequently, predation by M. dolomieu was presumed to be the critical mechanism explaining the loss of indigenous fishes in the lower Rondegat River. Copyright {\copyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Central Valley drainage of California formerly produced immense numbers of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Four seasonal runs occur in this system---fall, latefall, winter, and spring runs. Differences in life history timing and spatial distribution enabled the four runs to use the drainage to the fullest possible extent and once made it one of the richest regions in the world for chinook salmon production. Native American fishers within the Central Valley drainage harvested chinook salmon at estimated levels that reached 8.5 million pounds or more annually. Native harvests, therefore, were roughly comparable to the peak commercial harvests taken later by Euro-American fishers, but whether or not native fishing depressed the productive capacities of the salmon populations to any substantial degree is not known. The commercial chinook salmon fishery in California started about 1850 in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento--San Joaquin Delta region, where it formed the nucleus of the first major fishery conducted by Euro-American immigrants in the state. This fishery was one of the important early industries that supported the Euro-American settlement of the Central Valley region. The salmon fishery remained centered there until the early 1900s, when ocean salmon fishing began to expand and eventually came to dominate the fishery. Annual catches by the early Sacramento--San Joaquin in-river fishery commonly reached 4--10 million pounds and generally were higher than the total statewide catches made during the most recent several decades. The historical abundances of Central Valley chinook salmon before large-scale commercial exploitation and depletion of the runs cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of early commercial catch records, the maximal production levels of the Central Valley chinook salmon stocks in aggregate may be conservatively estimated to have reached approximately 1--2 million spawners annually. Although substantial investment has been made by the state of California in managing the chinook salmon resource since the early years of the commercial fishery, chinook salmon have declined over the decades to small fractions of their previous numbers. The decline of the Central Valley chinook salmon resource was caused by several factors: overfishing, blockage and degradation of streams by mining activities, and reduction of salmon habitat and streamflows by dams and water diversions. Differences between the four chinook salmon runs in life history timing and habitat requirements partly account for their different population histories; the winter run is now threatened with extinction, the spring run recently has approached a similarly imperiled state, and the late-fall run has been at moderately low population levels for the past two decades. Only the fall run, in aggregate, can be regarded as secure, but it too has undergone substantial reductions in abundance. Fall-run spawner numbers were especially low in the San Joaquin River basin in recent years, and in Sacramento River basin streams their numbers have been heavily influenced by production of hatchery fish.},

  abstract = {Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) formerly occurred in great abundance within the California Central Valley drainage and were a correspondingly important part of the subsistence economics and cultures of the indigenous peoples of that region. Salmon and other fishery resources on the Central Valley floor were part of a resource base that enabled resident Native American groups to attain some of the highest population densities to occur among the non-agricultural native societies of North America. Indirect estimates of aboriginal harvests prior to Euro-American settlement of the region indicate that the native fishers may have exploited the Central Valley salmon resource on a level comparable to that later attained by the immigrant Euro-American fishers of the late ninteenth century commercial fishery. The salmon resource also figured, to varying degrees, in native interactions--- from trade item to causa belli. Among the last intact native groups in California reliant on a salmon-based subsistence economy were the McCloud River Wintu---a people who were instrumental in the successful operation of the U.S. Fish Commission egg-collecting station on the lower McCloud River that supplied salmon eggs for shipments to U.S. Eastern states and overseas countries. Prior to 1850, mention of salmon was made perodically by Spanish chroniclers and by European and (U.S.) American observers who traveled through the region. Sustained harvests of salmon by Euro-Americans did not begin until the California Gold Rush period, starting in 1848. The commercial salmon fishery of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and Delta region was one of the earliest major industries of California during the period of (U.S.) American settlement. The fishery frequently attained harvest levels of 4 to 10 million pounds (1.8 to 4.5 million kg) per year during the highly productive early decades of operation (1870s to 1900s), and it contributed substantially to the regional economy. Despite the general decline of Pacific salmon resources in California and the Pacific Northwest region since the early period of commercial exploitation, chinook salmon have continued to contribute significantly to the state and local economies in recent decades. Aside from its importance as a food commodity, other aspects of the value of the salmon resource (viz., biological, recreational, and aesthetic benefits) are being increasingly recognized. The chinook salmon resource of the California Central Valley --- having provided material and amenity benefits to both native and immigrant peoples for so long in the past --- may yet continue to fulfill the needs of humans in the future if we of the present make it so.},
